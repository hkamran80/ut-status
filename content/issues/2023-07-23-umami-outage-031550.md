*Postmortem* - An error during a configuration update to a separate service overloaded the container orchestration system, and caused the host system to crash. A reboot was forced, and the system came up shortly after. Umami did not come online instantly due to an error with the container setup system. The error was resolved, and the service is now fully online.

*Resolved* - The issue has been resolved, and Umami is back online. A full postmortem will be posted soon. {{< track "2023-07-23 03:22:15" >}}
